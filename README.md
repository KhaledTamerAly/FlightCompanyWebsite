# Code Examples
This is where you try to compress your project and make the reader understand what it does as simply as possible. This should help the reader understand if your code solves their issue.

# How to Use?
As I have mentioned before, you never know who is going to read your readme. So it is better to provide information on how to use your project. A step-by-step guide is best suited for this purpose. It is better to explain steps as detailed as possible because it might be a beginner who is reading it.
